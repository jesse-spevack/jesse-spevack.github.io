<h1>Why and how to automate your school's knowledge management</h1>
<p>In a small New York City public high school, an hour long department meeting that includes five teachers costs roughly $150 in salary. If that department meets for an hour each week for the entire school year, which would not be uncommon, the in salary cost is $5,625. If in that same school there are actually four departments that meet once a week for an hour, the yearly expenditure rises to roughly $22,500. While this is not a significant portion of a typical New York City public high school budget, it is often an expense whose impact is very difficult to capture and evaluate against other opportunities. Often the best case scenario at the end of a year-long curriculum development project spanning many hours of meetings is a beautifully organized physical binder that very few teachers end up using regularly.</p>
<p>Knowledge management, or the curation of institutional documents, is critical to the way schools deal with assumptions of staff attrition and over reliance on particular individuals. Organizational documentation should not be unchanging standard operating procedures, as in the case of the aforementioned physical binder, but rather dynamic, easily-locatable, shared documents, that reflect the state of collective practice at a given point in time.</p>
