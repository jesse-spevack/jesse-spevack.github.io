<h2>Why going deep into new content is important if you want to get paid.</h2>
<p>From the start of my adult life it was obvious that the days of working for one company for an entire career were long gone. However, I did not realize the extent to which dramatic career change would be a feature of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail_Generation">Oregon Trail Generation</a>'s experience. As many of you know, I moved from a decade plus long career in education into the world of software engineering. Many of my peers either have expressed a longing to do some type of similar career shift, are currently engaged in their own formal continuing education program, or are well into their second, third or fourth careers. I believe the multi-careerist trend is only going increase.</p>
<h3>Re-tooling is a thing</h3>
<p>Retooling is the process of developing new skills and in this context, specifically to improve one's economic opportunities. If you have not tried it yourself, you probably know someone who has. If you do not know someone who has, you will as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-jobs-automation-risk/">automation</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/the-future-of-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Average-Over-Powering-America-Stagnation/dp/0525953736">macroeconomic forces</a>Â push more and more of us into new careers that we did not plan for in our late teens.</p>
<p>For some, retooling means shifting departments, subject areas, moving into management. For many of us, retooling involves formal and informal education - whether that means reading a book, completing online coursework, enrolling in graduate school, or in my case going to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.turing.io/">code school</a>.</p>
<h3>Strategies for Re-Tooling VIA Code School</h3>
<p>Having gone through a code school re-tool myself, I often get asked what topics I wish I knew more about coming out of code school and vice versa. It is important to note that with perfect hindsight it is easy to look back at any curriculum and pick out what is currently valuable and what is not. While I recognize that I am about to engage in some Monday morning quarterbacking, I think the larger point that depth is more valuable to employers than breadth is worth considering.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I chose to enroll at Turing was because it was a significantly longer than some of the alternatives. I found it easy to believe that getting more practice with a new tool set would have the affect of making me more marketable to employers.</p>
