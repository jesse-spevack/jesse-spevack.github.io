<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Three years after completing the <a href="https://turing.io/">Turing School of Software and Design</a> I have feelings. Turing is a code school whose mission is to “is to unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.” My goal in sharing my experience is to equip prospective students, current students, and recent graduates of the program with information that can help inform their own career decisions. You can also read previous reflections that I wrote upon <a href="http://www.jessespevack.com/blog/2017/1/12/turing-review">graduating</a> and then <a href="http://www.jessespevack.com/blog/2017/5/31/xvqgw24b6ufdqoi6hv5d9t3s7263yr">six months after</a> graduation.</p>
<h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why turing</h2>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is crazy to to lump Turing into the bootcamp bucket with schools that only have twenty to fifty percent of the technical content (not to mention non-technical skill development). Many of the programs that Turing is compared against are for-profit. Some are backed by venture capital, whose interests may not be completely aligned with those of their students. A small few have been complete scams. Turing, on the other hand, is a not for profit school which means that it never has to consider trade offs between profit and educational quality or student support.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Turing as an institution is comprised of some remarkable people, many of whom I still know and keep in touch with regularly. Executive Director Jeff Casimir is the real deal - always pushing the program to do better by way of its students. There seems to be an inverse proportion between the quantity of praise  </p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why this program? - Jeff / Ellenmary and co. Non profit.</p></li>
<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Will you succeed in the program? - Parent, professional experience, coding experience</p></li>
<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How will you get a job? - Grind</p></li>
<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Job outcome for me - Increased salary, learning, low stress, high fulfillment</p></li>
