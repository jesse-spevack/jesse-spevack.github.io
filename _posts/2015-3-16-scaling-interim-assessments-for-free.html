<p>My latest project at New Visions for Public Schools is to help eighty public high schools administer mock Regents exams in four out of five graduation critical subject areas. Much has been written about the importance of <a target="_blank" href="http://uncommonschools.org/our-approach/thought-leadership/driven-by-data-book-paul-bambrick-santoyo">data driven instruction</a>, but there is less information about the technical considerations that are a prerequisite for ensuring that all students are receiving instruction that addresses their needs. </p>
<h2>A Shared Platform for Data Driven Instruction</h2>
<p>The mock Regents projects relies on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/education/">Google Apps for Education</a>, a free communications and productivity platform, to share information. We use one Google Spreadsheet for each of our four exam subject areas: Common Core Algebra, United States History, Global History, and Living Environment. Google sheets offer several advantages to Microsoft Excel, online gradebooks, or pen and paper based tracking. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sharing information with Google Sheets is <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?hl=en">simple</a>. I can add teachers and school leaders as viewers or editors. Additionally, I can <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1218656?hl=en">hide</a> sheets that contain reference information and even lock sections of the spreadsheet using <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/144687?hl=en">protected ranges</a>. I can also easily embed a Google Sheet in a staff-facing website or make use of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/available-web-apps/awesome-tables">Awesome Tables</a>.</li>
<li>The data I share is always synchronized because there is only one copy. If I wanted to share student assessment data using Excel, I would have email an .xls file which has the affect of potentially creating as many copies of my original file as I have recipients on my email. Any time spent reconciling edits across multiple files is less time spent on personalizing instruction.</li>
<li>Google Spreadsheets are flexible; product engineers at ed-tech companies are not. The kinds of data dashboards and displays I build are only limited by my own understanding of Google Spreadsheets - not the engineering team at an online Grade book company. If I decide that I want to identify students who struggle with, for example <a target="_blank" href="http://a2i.newvisions.org/algebra-1/unit-2">Linear, Quadratic, And Exponential Models</a>, I can use the native <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/newvisions.org/cloudlab-spreadsheet-fundamentals/mini-challenge-9-three-ways-to-filter">filter function</a> to build my list instead of begging my grade book provider to put that report on their development timeline.</li>
