<h2>A Live Blogged How To Facebook with Ruby on Rails Guide</h2>
<p>As many of you know, I have a <a href="https://spevacktwins.herokuapp.com/">photo sharing application side project</a> that I use to learn new technologies and share photos of my kids with my family. In the past I would upload a photo and then login to Facebook and post a link to my photo app with a brief message. This is something that should be fairly straight forward to automate.</p>
<p>Unlike past blog posts in which I write detailed steps after the fact and sometimes in fairly contrived contexts, in this post I will write as I develop. It's an experiment which I hope will make it easier for me to get useful content out to all of you. </p>
<h3>Where To Begin</h3>
<p>I start by scanning through Facebook's API documentation. A few minutes of Googling makes me fairly certain that the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Graph API</a> is the thing I will use to post to my own feed. Apparently there is a third party <a href="https://github.com/arsduo/koala">gem</a> I could use, but I think it's a good strategy to avoid dependencies that I have limited control over as much as possible. Furthermore, for the needs of this project I am really only concerned with one API endpoint so adding code that supports the entire Graph API seems like overkill to me.</p>
<h3>Credentials</h3>
<p>I'm going to start by getting some credentials so I can use the Graph API with my application. According to the documents, the type of credential I will need is an access token, specifically a user access token.</p>
